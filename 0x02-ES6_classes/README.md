# CLASSES

Classes in JavaScript are objects and they are majorly used for creating blueprints for an object.

Classes are created with the `class` keyword and instances of every classes are created with `new class`.

Classes also has constructors which are used for instanciating newly created class and it also uses the `this` keyword to refer to the class itself.

Classes are great way of creating your own object blueprint which has lots of methods as well as variables(class field or instance field).

## Types of class methods

1. static methods => only accessible by the class itself.
2. Instance methods => these are functions that can be called by an instance of a class.
